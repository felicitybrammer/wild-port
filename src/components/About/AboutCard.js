         <p> Iâ€™m an ex-teacher who loves solving logic problems and building things with code. </p>

<p>My classes loved the new experiences, and I enjoyed learning with them. We built some simple apps in the classroom - a game of tic-tac-toe, an art colouring tool, and a murder mystery themed text analysis tool. </p>

Then I was promoted and had less time. </p>

I was coding every day, late into the night, and on weekends. Until I was ready to be unleashed on production code.</p>
